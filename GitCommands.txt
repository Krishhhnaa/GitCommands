Basic Git Commands :

1. git init --> to initialize the local folder (we tell git that now you should track this folder for any uncoming changes whatsoever)

2. git status --> to check the untracked files

3. git add . --> to add all the files in staging area 

4. git add names.txt --> to add only this name file in staging area

5. git commit -m "message" --> to commit the changes that you have made
